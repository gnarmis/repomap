# Repo Man

- keep track of git repos in a dumb flat file
- CLI: 'repo', 'repo ls', 'repo add .', 'repo rm .'

## Notes

- assumptions
  - 'repo add <path>' -> add the git repo at that path to our file
  - we know path to check
  - need the yaml file somewhere on path
- check if path is a git repo
- add path to our file, with name of folder as reponame
